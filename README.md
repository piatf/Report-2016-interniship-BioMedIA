Francois Piat's thesis about his internship in BioMedIA in 2016.

# IMPORTANT : The main file is a PDF file, which is located in the main folder.

An ODP file is also available, gathering all the slides for the presentation of my work. The presentation took place in my engineering school in France : INSA Centre Val de Loire 

A folder is available to consult any report send weekly to my supervisor during the first weeks of the internship.
